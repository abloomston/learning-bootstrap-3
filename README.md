Code from taking [online course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-3/) providing an introduction to bootstrap.

All course provided files are in `course-files/`.

To view the site, call `open site/index.html`.

I use [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [impatient-mode](https://github.com/netguy204/imp.el) for easy viewing of files as I edit them:

```
(find-file "site/index.html")
M-x httpd-start
M-x impatient-mode
;; Then open http://localhost:8080/imp/live/index.html/
```
